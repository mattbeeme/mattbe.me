# About MattBe - Kind of a DJ

Years ago, I hated dance music, it was for people who can't manage to think about anything but boom, boom, boom. Then, randomly, i got dragged to a club where a cousin of mine was dj-ing, as I watched him behind the decks I started to understand I had massively miss-understood dance music.
I started with Virtual DJ (Yuck!) and a twenty quid mixer from cash-converter, I got the bug. As life went on I moved up in equipment and skills.
I don't see myself as a DJ, I have no aspiration to be one, I simply learnt how to DJ because it entertains my brain and over time I realised that there is a massive mental health benefit too this.

## Equipment

Finally reached a point when I could purchase the stuff i've always wanted, I currently have a pioneerDJ XDJ-XZ controller paired with 2 pioner 1000 turntables (turntables are more for nostalgia reasons, when I fancy like re-visiting the past I fire these up).
Given the top end equipment i now own, i also built my own DJ booth in my spare room, yes it's a little silly but that's me.
