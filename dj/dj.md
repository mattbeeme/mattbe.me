# About MattBe - The kinda of DJ

Years ago, i hated dance music, it was for people who can't manage to thnk about anything but boom, boom, boom. Then randomly i got dragged to a club where a cousin of mine was dj-ing, as i watched him being the decks i started to understand i massively miss-understood dance music.
I started with Virtual DJ (Yuck!) and a twenty quid mixer from cash-converter, i got the bug. As life went on i moved up in equipment and skills.
I don't see myself as a DJ, i have no aspiration to be one, i simply learnt how to DJ because it entertains my brain and over time i realised that there is a massive mental health benefit too this.

## Equipment

Finally reached a point when i could purchase the stuff i've always wanted, i currently have a pioneerDJ XDJ-XZ controller paired with 2 pioner 1000 turntables (turntables are more for nostalgia reasons, when i fancy like revisiting the past i fire these up).
Given the top end equipment i now own, i also built my own DJ booth in my spare room, yes it's a little silly but that's me.
